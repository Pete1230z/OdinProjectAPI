CLASS
A class is a reference type that defines a blueprint for objects.

- Defines structure (properties, fields)
- May define behavior (methods)
- Does nothing by itself until instantiated

    PROPERTY
    A named member of a class that exposes a value through accessors.

    - Has a type
    - Has a name
    - Has one or more accessors (get, set)
    - Commonly used for configuration and data models

    Example:
    public string? ForceStructureAPI { get; set; }

    FIELD
    A variable declared directly inside a class.

    - Stores data directly
    - Typically private
    - Less flexible than properties

    Example:
    private string _baseUrl;

    METHOD
    A block of code inside a class that performs an action.

    - Contains executable logic
    - Can accept parameters
    - Can return a value or void

    Example:
    public void LoadConfiguration() { }

    CONSTRUCTOR
    A special method used to create and initialize an object.

    - Same name as the class
    - Runs when new is called
    - No return type

    Example:
    public OdinSettings() { }


OBJECT (INSTANCE)
A runtime instance of a class.

- Created using new
- Exists in memory at runtime

Example:
var settings = new OdinSettings();


TYPE
Defines what kind of data a variable, property, or parameter can hold.

- Determines valid operations
- Enforced at compile time

    REFERENCE TYPE
    - Stored on the heap
    - Passed by reference

    Examples:
    class
    string

    VALUE TYPE
    - Copied by value
    - Stored directly

    Examples:
    int
    bool
    struct

    NULLABLE
    Indicates a value may be null.

    - Used with reference types
    - Important for configuration binding

    Example:
    string?


NULL
Represents the absence of a value.

- Valid state unless explicitly prevented
- Must be checked before use

Example:
if (value == null)


ACCESS MODIFIERS
Control visibility of classes and members.

- public    → Accessible from anywhere
- private   → Accessible only within the containing class
- internal  → Accessible within the same assembly


NAMESPACE
A logical grouping of related classes.

- Prevents name collisions
- Organizes code

Example:
namespace OdinProjectAPI;


PROGRAM
The entry point of a .NET application.

- Execution starts here
- Typically located in Program.cs


CONFIGURATION
A system for supplying values to an application at runtime.

- External to compiled code
- Environment-specific

    CONFIGURATION BINDING
    Maps configuration values to C# objects by convention.

    - Property name ↔ configuration key
    - Class structure ↔ JSON structure


JSON
A text-based data format for structured data.

- Uses key–value pairs
- Human-readable

Example:
{
  "Odin": {
    "GraphQLEndPoint": "..."
  }
}


DTO (DATA TRANSFER OBJECT)
A class used only to carry data.

- Properties only
- No behavior
- Common for configuration and API responses

Example:
public class OdinSettingsDto
{
    public string? GraphQLEndPoint { get; set; }
    public string? OutputFolder { get; set; }
}
